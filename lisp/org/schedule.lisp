;;;; C-c C-s schedules the task point is under, C-c C-d gives it a deadline:
;;;; the date is asked for as any date is (read-date: fri, +3d, 10-15,
;;;; sep 30, tomorrow, 2026-12-24 14:00, 3pm), the timestamp it reads shown as it is
;;;; typed, a date already past taken in the year or month to come. The
;;;; planning line under the headline gets it, as Org writes it, a repeater
;;;; and warning there before kept; with C-u it is taken away. With
;;;; *org-log-reschedule* and *org-log-redeadline* the date it had is logged.
