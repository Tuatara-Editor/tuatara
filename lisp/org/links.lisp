;;;; lisp/org/links.lisp --- Org's links followed: RET on one, as org-return-follows-link, and C-c C-o.
;;;; Copyright (C) 2026 Michael A Jones.  GPL-3.0-or-later; see LICENSE.
;;;;
;;;; A link in an Org buffer is followed as Org's org-open-at-point follows
;;;; it. One to a headline (*Title), a custom ID (#id), a target or a name in
;;;; the buffer goes there. A file: link visits the file (with ::*Heading or
;;;; ::text, there in it). An id: link goes to the headline with that ID, here
;;;; or in the Org files of your notes (*formatted-file-directory*). A denote:
;;;; link visits the note with that identifier. A denote:query-filenames: link
;;;; lists the notes whose names match (match-denote-files-link inserts one).
;;;; A formatted-match: link does so by a regular expression
;;;; (match-formatted-files-link). A web address or a mail address is handed to
;;;; the desktop's program after asking, as it runs outside Tuatara.
