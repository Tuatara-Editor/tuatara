;;;;
;;;; Where the file system cannot share blocks between files (ext4, and every
;;;; one but btrfs, XFS, bcachefs and ZFS), a new file renamed over the old
;;;; costs a copy of every octet: a 10 GB file written whole for one line. A
;;;; large file the buffer reads where it is (mapped) holds most of the new
;;;; text already where it belongs, so with *SAVE-IN-PLACE*, where the changes,
;;;; with the journal below, come to less than two thirds of the file, it is
;;;; saved in place:
;;;;
;;;;   1. The octets the save overwrites or cuts off, in whole pages, are
;;;;      copied into a file with no name beside the file, after a header
;;;;      naming the file, its length and where they came from; that journal
;;;;      is flushed, named .NAME.tuatara-journal and the directory flushed.
;;;;   2. The buffer's text, and its undo history, read those octets from the
;;;;      journal from then on.
;;;;   3. The changes are written into the file, its length set and the file
;;;;      flushed.
;;;;   4. The journal's name is taken away and the directory flushed.
;;;;
;;;; The file on disk is the old one until step 1 is on disk and the new one
;;;; once step 4 is. In between, after a crash or a power cut, it may be part
;;;; old and part new, with the journal beside it: the next time Tuatara opens
;;;; the file, or saves or reverts it, it puts the old file back exactly from
;;;; the journal before reading it (RECOVER-CUT-SHORT-SAVE), whatever
;;;; *SAVE-IN-PLACE* is by then, and a save waits until it has. Other programs
;;;; that read the file before then see it part saved. A save that fails, or
;;;; is stopped, while it writes the file puts the old one back at once.
;;;;
;;;; A journal is used only when it is a file of its own (one name, written by
;;;; its owner alone, who owns the file and runs Tuatara), no save or putting
;;;; back holds it (each holds a lock on it throughout), and it fits the file:
;;;; the same file, born when it was, its length between the old and the new,
;;;; last changed by the save. While while a save writes, it marks its journal with
;;;; the time every few seconds, so that a change to the file after the save
;;;; was cut short is told from one the save made. Anything else, such as
;;;; another program having written the file since, is said and nothing
;;;; written, and the file is not saved while the journal is there. A journal
;;;; held by a save going on, or a putting back, is waited for a little; the
;;;; file is not opened meanwhile.
;;;; FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE and COLLAPSE_RANGE, which open or close a gap of
;;;; whole blocks, are not used: an edit of text is almost never a whole
;;;; number of blocks long and at a block boundary.

(defvar *save-in-place* nil
  "True to save a large file by writing only what changed into the file
itself, where that is quicker than writing it whole; NIL, as standard, to
write every save as a new file put in the old one's place.

It is used on ext4 and the other file systems that cannot share blocks
between files (all but btrfs, XFS, bcachefs and ZFS, where a new file costs
no more than the change anyway), for a file of over 64 MB on a local drive,
when the edit keeps the length of the text or lies in about the last third
of the file. A 10 GB file with one line changed is then saved in a few
hundredths of a second, where writing it whole takes about a minute. An
edit nearer the start moves all that follows it, so it is saved as a new
file either way.

What such a save will overwrite is first copied into .NAME.tuatara-journal
beside the file and put on the disk; the journal goes once the changes are
on the disk too. The trade-off: should the computer crash or lose power
during such a save, another program that reads the file before Tuatara
opens it again may find it half saved. Tuatara itself always gets the old
file or the new one: the next time it opens, saves or reverts the file, it
puts the old file back exactly from the journal, whatever this setting is
then. It does so only when the journal is surely that save's: one the file
has been changed after is left, said, and the file not saved until you
remove it. On a file system that keeps no birth time for files (ext4 made
with 128-octet inodes), a new file made under the old name that the system
gave the old one's number is told apart from it only by its times. With
NIL, every program finds the old file or the new one. A file opened safely,
or in an evidence folder, is never written, so never put back either.")
