;;;; src/io/save.lisp --- Saving files: by rename, in place, or in the background.
;;;; Copyright (C) 2026 Michael A Jones.  GPL-3.0-or-later; see LICENSE.
;;;;
;;;; A new file with no name is written beside the old one, flushed to
;;;; disk, given the old one's owner, permissions and extended attributes
;;;; (SELinux label, ACLs), named, renamed over it, and the directory flushed;
;;;; the file on disk is always the old one or the new one, even after a power
;;;; cut, and a crash while writing leaves nothing behind. Where the file system
;;;; has no unnamed files, a hidden named one serves. A symlink is followed and
;;;; kept. A file with several names (hard links), one whose owner or group this
;;;; user cannot give a new file, a directory where no file can be made, a
;;;; rename the file system refuses, and the pseudo file systems are written in
;;;; place instead, after a backup copy that is kept if the write fails. A save
;;;; never overwrites a file changed since it was read without being told to.
;;;; Large buffers are saved in the background. With *SAVE-IN-PLACE*, on a
;;;; file system that cannot share blocks, a large file the buffer reads where
;;;; it is has only its changes written, in place, after a journal of what they
;;;; overwrite, when that writes less (in-place.lisp).
;;;;
;;;; Copying octets that come from the file (the unchanged parts of a large
;;;; buffer) is left to the kernel (copy_file_range), which shares blocks
;;;; instead where the file system can and the offsets allow; the rest is
;;;; written.

block as where it goes (after edits that kept the length, or none), it is
copied up to the next block boundary first, so that file systems that share
blocks share all the whole ones after it.
The octets go out to the device as they are written, *WRITE-OUT-WINDOW* at a
time, and leave memory once there. So a slow device (a USB drive) holds a
large save back as it goes rather than all at the end, and memory does not
fill with what waits for it. PROGRESS is called with the octets on the device
and the total.
KEPT, for a file that holds much of ROPE already, is a function of a stretch
from a mapped file (its MAPPING, the OFFSET in it, its LENGTH and the POSITION
it goes to). It gives whether the file holds its first octets already where
they go, and how many from there are alike. Those it holds are passed over,
not written. Returns true, or NIL when CANCEL's car turned true first."
